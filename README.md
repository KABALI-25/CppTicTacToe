# CppTicTacToe

This project mainly is focussed on the Tic Tac Toe game.

The program produces a screen with the TicTacToe box on the screen and then can be played by multiple users taking 'X' and 'O' symbols in the game. The code checks for the winning of the user in all the directions if there are any consecutive 3 similar signs and if they are there it would declare the respective user as the winner for the game and asks to exit or to continue for another game.
